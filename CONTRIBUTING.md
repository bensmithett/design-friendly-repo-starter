## Finding an existing issue to fix

Want to dive straight in & make this project better? Thanks!

Every bug or suggested improvement is assigned a bright yellow `expertise: ` label so we can see at a glance what skills are needed to resolve it. For example, [here are all the issues that need input from someone with design expertise](https://github.com/bensmithett/design-friendly-repo-starter/labels/expertise%3A%20design).

To find an issue you can help resolve or an improvement you can help implement, check the [list of labels](https://github.com/bensmithett/design-friendly-repo-starter/labels) for issues tagged with your particular area of expertise.

## Working on an issue

When you've found an issue you'd like to work on, read through any existing comments to get up to speed with work or planning that's already been done, then add a note letting other contributors know what you're going to do.

There's nothing worse than doing a whole bunch of work only to have it rejected. Big, unsolicited rewrites or redesigns run the risk of being at odds with the maintainers' vision for the project.

If you're happy to spend lots of time on work that might not be accepted, go for it!

Otherwise, where possible & practical, do your work in small, incremental chunks. Keep the issue updated with your progress so maintainers, contributors & other users have a chance to give your ideas feedback before you sink too much time & effort into them.

### Code

Post code samples, links to your fork or to running examples on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) that show your potential approach.

### Design & UX

Post wireframes, screenshots & GIF screen captures ([use LICEcap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to make GIFs!) that show the changes you're working on.

If possible, post links to source files (PSDs etc) in Dropbox or similar so others can iterate on your work.

## Submitting a pull request

If your contribution will change any of the code or assets in this repo, you'll need to [fork and submit a pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

### Code
