## Finding an existing issue to fix

Want to dive straight in & make this project better? Thanks!

Every bug or suggested improvement is assigned a bright yellow `expertise: ` label so we can see at a glance what skills are needed to resolve it. For example, [here are all the issues that need input from someone with design expertise](https://github.com/bensmithett/design-friendly-repo-starter/labels/expertise%3A%20design).

To find an issue you can help resolve or an improvement you can help implement, check the [list of labels](https://github.com/bensmithett/design-friendly-repo-starter/labels) for issues tagged with an area of expertise you're comfortable helping with.

## Working on an issue

When you've found an issue you'd like to work on, read through any existing comments to get up to speed with work or planning that's already been done, then add a note letting other contributors know what you're going to do.

There's nothing worse than doing a whole bunch of work only to have it rejected. Big, unsolicited rewrites or redesigns run the risk of being at odds with the maintainers' vision for the project.

If you're happy to spend time on work that might not be accepted, go for it!

Otherwise, where possible & practical, do your work in small, incremental chunks. Keep the issue updated with your progress so maintainers, contributors & other users have a chance to give your ideas feedback before you sink too much time & effort into them.

### Code

Post code samples, links to your fork or to running examples on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) that show your potential approach.

### Design & UX

Post wireframes, screenshots & GIF screen captures ([use LICEcap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to make GIFs!) that show the changes you're working on.

If possible, post links to source files (PSDs etc) in Dropbox or similar so others can iterate on your work.

## Submitting a pull request

If your contribution will change any of the code or assets in this repo, you'll need to [fork and submit a pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

### Code changes

Follow the coding style & conventions you see used in the existing code. 
<!-- Add more specific comments here, e.g. "use BEM syntax for CSS" -->

<!-- are there tests? -->
This project has an [automated test suite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation#Code-driven_testing) to help ensure we don't break anything. 

- If altering the code behind existing behaviour, ensure the tests pass by running `npm test`.
- If adding new behaviour, write new tests to cover it.

### Visual changes

If your change alters any of the UI in this project, be sure to include screenshots or GIF screen captures in your pull request description.

## Opening a new issue

### Bug reports

If you've found a bug with this project:

- Search the [issues](https://github.com/bensmithett/design-friendly-repo-starter/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue) to see if anyone else has had the same problem.
- If you don't find an existing issue, or do find one but it's been closed, create a [reduced test case](https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) to ensure there isn't just a problem with your code and publish it to [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) or similar.
- Open an issue with a detailed description of the problem, a link to your reduced test case and screenshots or GIF screen captures if necessary.

### Suggesting improvements

If you have an idea for an improvement to this project:

- Search the [issues](https://github.com/bensmithett/design-friendly-repo-starter/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue) to see if anyone has previously suggested a similar improvement.
  - If an issue exists already, feel free to join that conversation.
  - If not...
    - Open an issue describing a use case for your suggested change; or
    - If it's faster to just make the change, submit a pull request as above (keeping in mind that there's always a chance an unsolicited pull request might not be accepted)
